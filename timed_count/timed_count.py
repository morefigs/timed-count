    A generator function that returns  an iterator that delays each iteration by a specified time period. It can be used
    to repeatedly execute code at a precise frequency.
    :param period: The interval period, in seconds.
    :param start: The number of time counts to delay starting by.
    :param stop: The number of time counts to automatically stop after.
    :param temporal_resolution: The temporal resolution (or time error) to use when waiting for the next iteration, in
    seconds. A smaller value will give higher resolution and precision but result in higher CPU usage. Use caution
    lowering below the default value. This precision is for an individual iteration only, there is no cumulative time
    error over multiple iterations.
